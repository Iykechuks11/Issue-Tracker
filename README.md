# IssueTracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.1.

In this project, we will build an Angular application for managing and tracking issues using
reactive forms and Clarity. Initially, we will display a list of issues in a table that we can sort and
filter. We will then create a form for allowing users to report new issues. Finally, we will create
a modal dialog for resolving an issue. We will also go the extra mile and turn on suggestions
when reporting an issue to help users avoid duplicate entries. The following diagram depicts an
architectural overview of the project:
